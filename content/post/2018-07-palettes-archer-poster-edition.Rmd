[Jo-fai Chow](http://www.jofaichow.co.uk/)'s [rPlotter](https://github.com/woobe/rPlotter) is described as
"[w]rapper functions that make plotting in R a lot easier for beginners." I came upon it in its best and highest form, though, as "another" colour-palette generator for R.[^1] To be specific, I was drawn in by **_Palette Tarantino_**, which you can catch the code for in Chow's post, [Towards (Yet) Another R Colour Palette Generator](https://blenditbayes.blogspot.com/2014/05/towards-yet-another-r-colour-palette.html).

Being, well, me—my first thought was `r emo::ji("thinking")` _How could I involve Archer in this?_ So, let's Archify things... (Yes, his name's a verb, you'll just have to accept that fact!)

```{r load-lib, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
# devtools::install_github("woobe/rPlotter")
library(rPlotter)
```

### `rPlotter::extract_colours()`

I'll follow the [example](https://github.com/woobe/rPlotter#example-extract_colours) from the [rPlotter README](https://github.com/woobe/rPlotter) for extracting colours. I retrieved the [Archer posters](https://imgur.com/a/jPE0y95) for each season from the [Archer wiki](http://archer.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Seasons) (_duh_), which I'll use as my source images.


Before we get into the season-by-season posters, let's take a peek at what I consider to be the "generic" Archer poster of sorts.

![Archer poster](https://i.imgur.com/FyEALqr.jpg)

```{r season-1}
pal_a <- extract_colours("https://i.imgur.com/FyEALqr.jpg", num_col = 8)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
pie(rep(1, 8), col = pal_a, main = "Palette based on Archer Poster")
hist(Nile, breaks = 8, col = pal_a, main = "Palette based on Archer Poster")
```

I'm not loving this palette. I mean, I understand why it's happening—the suit, the background, the fire, but let's take another palette generator for a spin.

### `quickpalette::url_palette()`

Emil Hvitfeldt's [quickpalette](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/quickpalette) package "provide[s] a few tools to quickly acquire new color palettes to be used in R." We'll pair it with the [pals](https://github.com/kwstat/pals) package for easy layout generation.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("EmilHvitfeldt/quickpalette")
library(quickpalette)
library(pals)
```

We'll use the same image, so we can get a "fair" comparison between the packages.

```{r quickpal}
url <- "https://i.imgur.com/FyEALqr.jpg"
quickpalette::url_palette(url = url, n_clusters = 8) %>%
  pals::pal.bands()
```

Definitely getting a brighter vibe with this one. That's a lot of whitespace. Let's see if we can tighten things up with Jeroen Ooms' [magick](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html) package.

We'll need to read the image generated in the last chunk back in.

```{r quickpal-magic, message = FALSE}
library(magick)
image_read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbind/waxwings/rplotter/static/post/2018-07-18-palettes-archer-poster-edition_files/figure-html/quickpal-1.png") %>%
  image_trim()
```


### `paletter::create_palette()`

Let's try one more, Andrea Cirillo's [paletter](https://github.com/AndreaCirilloAC/paletter). Unlike the other two, paletter prefers an image path, so I'll use a local copy of the same image. There's a great post describing the math behind the methods in this package, which you can check out [here](https://datascienceplus.com/how-to-use-paletter-to-automagically-build-palettes-from-pictures/).

```{r paletter-lib, message = FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("AndreaCirilloAC/paletter")
library(paletter)
```

You have to specify a `type_of_variable` argument, so I'll go with `"categorical"`.

```{r paletter-pal, cache=TRUE}
image_path <- here::here("static", "img", "ArcherPosters", "archer-poster.jpg")
colours_vector <- create_palette(image_path,
                                 number_of_colors = 8, 
                                 type_of_variable = "categorical")
```

Though I like the layout of the output, paletter takes significantly longer than the other two packages. I also don't know why it outputs the palette twice. So...`r emo::ji("shrug")`

### A palette for all seasons

```{r qpal-season1}
pal_s1 <- quickpalette::url_palette(url = "https://i.imgur.com/14V7d86.jpg", n_clusters = 8)
pal_s1 %>%
  pals::pal.bands(labels = "season 1", main = "Archer Promo Poster Palettes")
```


Based on the code chunk above, I'm beginning to suspect that there might be a lot of copying and pasting involved, which means it's probably time for (you guessed it) a function. To make life even easier on myself, I'm going to use copies of the images, which I've conveniently suffixed with `_season*.jpg`.

I can use a combination of the [here](https://here.r-lib.org/) and [glue](https://glue.tidyverse.org/) packages to build paths to the images.

```{r glue-path}
season_num <- 2
here::here("static", "img", "ArcherPosters", glue::glue("ArcherPromoPoster_season{season_num}.jpg"))
```

But, as is suggested by the name, it turns out that `quickpalette::url_palette()` wants a URL, and _not_ a local file. Due to an acute attack of laziness, I popped all of the posters in a GitHub repo.

```{r glue-url}
season_num <- 2
poster_url <- glue::glue("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/batpigandme/mstash/master/images/ArcherPosters/ArcherPromoPoster_season{season_num}.png")
poster_url
```

```{r make-season-pal}
make_season_pal <- function(season_num) {
  s_num <- season_num
  poster_url <- glue::glue("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/batpigandme/mstash/master/images/ArcherPosters/ArcherPromoPoster_season{s_num}.png")
  pal_name <- glue::glue("pal_s{s_num}")
  pal_cols <- quickpalette::url_palette(url = poster_url, n_clusters = 8)
}
```


```{r make-season-pal-list, include=FALSE}
make_season_pal_list <- function(season_num) {
  s_num <- season_num
  poster_url <- glue::glue("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/batpigandme/mstash/master/images/ArcherPosters/ArcherPromoPoster_season{s_num}.png")
  pal_name <- glue::glue("pal_s{s_num}")
  pal_cols <- quickpalette::url_palette(url = poster_url, n_clusters = 8)
  pal_list <- as.list(pal_cols)
  return(pal_list)
}
```

```{r pal-each, include=FALSE}
pal_s1 <- make_season_pal(1)
pal_s2 <- make_season_pal(2)
pal_s3 <- make_season_pal(3)
pal_s4 <- make_season_pal(4)
pal_s5 <- make_season_pal(5)
pal_s6 <- make_season_pal(6)
pal_s7 <- make_season_pal(7)
pal_s8 <- make_season_pal(8)
pal_s9 <- make_season_pal(9)
```

Let's see those palettes...

```{r pals-all}
pals::pal.bands(pal_s1, pal_s2, pal_s3, pal_s4, pal_s5, pal_s6, pal_s7, pal_s8, pal_s9,
                labels = c("season 1", "season 2", "season 3", "season 4", "season 5", "season 6", "season 7", "season 8", "season 9"),
                main = "Archer Promo Poster Palettes")
```

Not bad! For comparison, here's the set generated when I sent the same posters into the [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) tool online (which, I assume, is more professional).

![Archer promo-poster palettes generated with Adobe Color Wheel](https://i.imgur.com/qRD06kM.png?1)

```{r archer-frame, include=FALSE}
archer_seasons <- tibble(
  season_num = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9),
  num_word = c(
    "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven",
    "eight", "nine"
  )
)
```

```{r poster-frame, include=FALSE}
archer_seasons %>%
  mutate(poster_url = glue::glue("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/batpigandme/mstash/master/images/ArcherPosters/ArcherPromoPoster_season{season_num}.png")) %>%
  mutate(pal_name = glue::glue("pal_s{season_num}"))
```

[^1]: Author's words, not mine—I would never disparrage the importance of colour-palette generators.
